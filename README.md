File stock_cruncher.bas will automatically run through all sheets on Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx to retrieve the following data:
* The ticker symbol.
* Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year. 
* The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
* The total stock volume of the stock.

All data is displayed in a fully automated color coded summary table.

There is an additional automated table that displays the greatest percentage increase, greatest percentage decrease and greatest volume from the summary table.
